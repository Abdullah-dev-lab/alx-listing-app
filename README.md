# ALX LISTING APP.
The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.

# Key Highlights
**Project Setup:**

Scaffold a Next.js application named alx-listing-app with TypeScript, ESLint, and TailwindCSS enabled.
Configure TailwindCSS using a minimal and clean configuration (tailwind.config.js and globals.css).
**Folder Structure and Reusability:**

Establish a clean folder structure, including directories for components/, interfaces/, constants/, and public/assets/.
Create reusable components such as Card and Button for modularity and scalability.
**TypeScript Integration:**

Define TypeScript interfaces (CardProps, ButtonProps, etc.) in interfaces/index.ts to ensure type safety and code consistency.
**Asset Management:**

Organize assets, including images and SVGs, under public/assets/ for easy access and maintenance.
